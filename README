Description
===========

This  program allows renaming of multiple files at once by providing an editor with
the names of the given files. This way the sophisticated features  of  this  editor
(for example vim) can be used to rename a whole bunch of files.  The editor used is
the one specified in the environment variable $EDITOR.  If this  environment  vari‐
able is empty, sensible-editor is used.

The filenames displayed in the editor are just the base filenames without the path,
since the path can’t be altered.  It is possible to edit the names of files in dif‐
ferent directories at once.

If  the  target  name  of  a  file already exists, this file is skipped (unless the
--overwrite or --interactive option is given).

See the manpage for more details about the allowed options.

Bugs
====

Since this is the first released version of immv there may be bugs. Due to
the nature of immv (renaming and possibly overwriting files) data loss is
possible. 

If you find bugs, please report them.
