* Finer grained output (maybe --verbose, not --quiet)
  - "No change to file" is often not of interest.
* Shorten and canonicalize output
  /tmp/origfile0 -> /tmp/newfile0
  /tmp/origfile1 -> /tmp/newfile1 - Error! Permission denied
  /tmp/origfile3 -> /tmp/newfile3
  Maybe at the first char the success
  i.e. '!' == Error, ' ' == success
    or '!' == Error, ' ' == no change, '.' == success
* Automatic testing (unit test doesn't help?)
