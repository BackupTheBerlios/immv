NAME
----
immv - Interactive Multi MoVe


SYNOPSIS
--------
*immv* ['options'] FILES


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program allows renaming of multiple files at once by providing an
editor with the names of the given files.
This way the sophisticated features of this editor (for example vim)
can be used to rename a whole bunch of files.
The editor used is the one specified in the environment variable
'$EDITOR'.
If this environment variable is empty, sensible-editor is used.
This can be overridden with the *--editor* option.

The filenames displayed in the editor are just the base filenames
without the path, since the path can’t be altered.
It is possible to edit the names of files in different directories at 
once.

If the target name of a file already exists, this file is skipped 
(unless the *--overwrite* or *--interactive* option is given).

OUTPUT
------
The output of immv is formatted for easy human readability as well as easy
parsing by other tools. It consists of three parts, a character indicating
the success state of the change, the changed file (and the result if
appropriate) and a more detailed message if necessary. All in one line.

The possible outcomes are:

*Success*::
	Indicated by a plus sign (*+*), followed by the original filename and
	the new filename.

*No change*::
	Indicated by a blank space, followed by the original filename an
	possibly an additional message, if actually a rename was requested.

*Error*::
	Indicated by an exclamation mark (*!*), followed by the original
	filename and the requested new filename. Usually followed by an
	additional message describing the error.

Here is an example of the output of all three possible success states:

-----------------------------------------------------------
+ a/bneido/ciekd  -->  a/bneido/Ciekd
  a/bneido/Aiei
! a/aragon/Anad   -->  a/aragon/anad - Permission denied
-----------------------------------------------------------

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
* *::
	(blank space) No change. No change was requested. May include a
	description if actually a rename was requested but couldn't be
	fulfilled.

*!*::
	Error. A rename was requested, but resulted in an error. Usually
	includes a description of the error.


Examples::
	+ a/bneido/ciekd   -->  a/bneido/Ciekd
	  a/bneido/Aiei
	! a/aragon/Anad    -->  a/aragon/anad - Permission denied 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    successfully completed

*1*::
    aborted before doing anything

*2*::
    failure while processing


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

    If '$EDITOR' is set, it will be used for editing the file names,
